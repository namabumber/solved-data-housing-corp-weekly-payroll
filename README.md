Write a Java program to create a payroll report based on the following assumptions and requirements:



A company called Data Housing Corp. employs several employees, all employees are paid on hourly base, any employee who works over than 40 hours is entitled to be paid overtime (1.5 for every hour exceeding 40).

Calculate:

1.                   The Gross income: Gross income = (Rate * hours worked) + over time.

2.                   The Overtime:  Overtime = number of hours exceeding 40 * Rate* 1.5

3.                   State Tax:          State Tax = gross * 6%

4.                   Federal Tax:     fed Tax = Gross * 12%

5.                   Union fees:       Union fees = Gross * 2%

6.                   Net:                  Net = Gross – (state tax + fed tax + Union fees).

7.                   Total Gross for all employees.

8.                   Average Gross for all employees.
